# DMSApp

A simple Document Management System (DMS) mobile app built with **React Native** â€” created as an assignment.  
This project demonstrates the UI flow and functionality for Login, Upload, and Search screens.  
> Note: Some parts use mocked data (if backend is unavailable). See the Postman collection included in the repo.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
Features implemented (frontend):
- OTP-based **Login** (calls API if available, else mocked)
- **Upload** screen: file picker (image/PDF), date, major/minor heads, tags, remarks (uploads to API if token is present)
- **Search** screen: filter by major/minor head, tags, date range; preview images/PDFs and download files
- Navigation with React Navigation
- API helpers in `services/` (axios)

APIs referenced (Postman collection included):
- `generateOTP`, `validateOTP`, `saveDocumentEntry`, `searchDocumentEntry`, `documentTags`
(See `Document Management.postman_collection.json` in repo)

ðŸ“Œ Notes for evaluators

I am a beginner; implemented frontend screens and wiring with axios service helpers.

Backend endpoints (as per assignment Postman collection) are included and the app will call them if reachable.

If the backend is not available during evaluation, mock responses are used â€” instructions in code comments.
